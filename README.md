- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Danny-the-scientist! I have a PhD in [Cell and Molecular Biology](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0003-4972-6737) which focused on stem cell biology and mutagenesis as well as extensively working on bioinformatic analyses and combinatorial work.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in biology, bioinformatics, computational biology, ontologies, and more!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my skills in various programming languages, and while I'm not capable of being a full-time programmer with extensive biology knowledge, I want to drastically improve my programming capabilities.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - best way will be through my [website](http://www.dcooper.science)
